BTW, a few other editor refinements you might consider:
- I have END/^E move the cursor to one beyond the last non-space character on the line (rather than to the last column on the screen).  Basically, move to the next possible insert point,
- I have DEL/^D delete the character under the cursor (pulling the rest of the line back to fill in)
- I have ^K delete all characters to the right of the cursor.  This is especially helpful to make room for a new command (like LIST) after editing a line in the middle of a previous listing.  Otherwise, you need to find or make a clear line for the next command.
