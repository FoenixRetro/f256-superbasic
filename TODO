Progress:
	Break doesn't work at all ?
	Break check fails on paged ROM (verify this now works).
	Alt Keyboard Driver
	
	Cross module call on timer check may not work as is, not re-entrant ? Silence sound at Warm Start ? Wait for it to return. Needs some bullying.
	Not initialised flag on variables. ?
	map()
	Ticktimer during listing.
	Continue documentation.
	Debug Hack
	tiles ?
	DMA ?
	RTC ?
	CSV Functions ?
	Remove Breakcheck fudge	
	No games work on Real Kernel (Joystick functionality)

Ongoing:
	Code reading.
	
Later:
	Changing Kerning ?

Discover:
	Is break fired first time ? Yes, returns $72 in P
	Initial value of $0 is $7F
