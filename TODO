			MEMCOPY <addr>,<size> POKE <byte>

			MEMCOPY <addr> RECT <x>,<y> BY <width> TO <address>
			MEMCOPY <addr> RECT <x>,<y> BY <width> POKE <byte>

	HOWTO:
		Create assembler programs (wait on Kernel change)

2. Set up tracking variables for 'dx', 'dy', 'dz', and 'buttons' from the mouse_delta event.  Every time you get a new mouse.DELTA event in #1, add its dx,dy,dz 
values to your cumulative values, and replace your buttons value with the new value from the event.   Whenever your tracking variables are read by the basic 
program (perhaps assign one or more functions to read them), reset them to zero.
3. Set up tracking variables for mouse button inner_count, middle_count, outer_count, and pending.  Every time you get a new mouse.CLICKS event in #1, 
replace the values in these variables with the new values from the event (pending just gets set to something non-zero).  Whenever the variables are read by 
the basic program, reset them to zero.
4. When it comes time to implement your key-status function, declare an array of 256 bytes (zero'd on startup).  Every time you get a key.PRESSED event, 
use either the .raw or .ascii value (depending on how you want to handle ENTER/ESC/TAB/etc. vs meta keys) to index the array, and store a non-zero value
there to indicate that the key is pressed.  Every time you get a key.RELEASED event, clear the associated value.  Now your function to test whether a 
key is presently held down or not can simply consult the array.
