Tiles:

	Default tilemap pages.
	Implement tilepos,tileread,tilewrite
	Implement BASIC interface and document asyou go.

Progress:	
 	Upgrade model A.
	Display Kernel version
	Consider STEP.
	Should CR in PRINT clear to EOL.

Ongoing:
	Code reading.

TILEMAP 
	[ON <n>] 						Turn tilemap on/off and select current, defaults to 0. 
	[OFF <n>] 
	[AT <data>] 					Tilemap data location, default $24000 (8192 bytes)
	[IMAGE <tiledata>] 				Tilemap images location, default $26000 (8192 bytes, 128 8x8 tiles)
	[DIM <x>,<y>] 					Size of the actual map in tiles (default 64x32 = 1 screen - must be powers of 2)
	[TO <xtile>,<ytile>] 			Scroll by tile.
	[SCROLL <xscroll>,<yscroll>] 	Scroll by offset e.g. pixel offset from top left.
	[DIM <size>] 					16 can be 8. (may not support 16 - would be tiny tiles)

TILE <x>,<y>,<tile1>,<tile2> PLOT <count> .....

	Output a sequence of tiles at <x>,<y>, can write multiple horizontal tiles with one instruction, and multiple copies
	of a single tile.

=TILE(<x>,<y>)

	Read the tile at <x>,<y> of the currently selected tilemap.
