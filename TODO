I did run into some rather odd behaviors trying to implement the maze of slashes in SuperBASIC:
- I don't think rnd(1) ever returned a value >= 0.5
- the expression (rnd(1)>0.2) returns (IIRC) 0 if false, and -1 if true, but if I use that result in an expression, BASIC seemed to think that the result type was FLOAT.
- Assigning the comparison result to a variable didn't work right, but I could assign rnd(1) to a variable.  When I did so, it became a large integer rather than a float.
My final working code was:
10 a=rnd(1)
20 a=a&1
30 print chr$(45+47*a);
40 goto 10

10 print chr$(45-(rnd(1)>0.5)*47);
20 goto 10
