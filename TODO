BTW, a few other editor refinements you might consider:

- I have END/^E move the cursor to one beyond the last non-space character on the line (rather than to the last column on the screen).  
- I have DEL/^D delete the character under the cursor (pulling the rest of the line back to fill in)
- I have ^K delete all characters to the right of the cursor.
