Progress:
	Speed up the backload by hacking the emulator.
	Wire in unary functions and add testing for true/false and general unary functions
	Shift tokens, move ASSERT.
	Comparison strings.
	Clear code (also reset procedures to arrays ? - scan later)
	Float add, subtract, multiply, divide, compare (?) [short divide is wrong !]
	Float testing code
	Integer & Fractional functions
	
Later:
	Error : out of identifier space
	Todo : scan for procedures (part of CLEAR)	
	Code to access variables in term.
	Encoding Decimals (e.g. .90132)
	Variable code
	Improve CALL
