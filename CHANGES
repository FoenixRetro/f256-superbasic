cd ..Changes summary:

	NEW: First alpha release/official binaries.

Release 5 (26/11/22):
	
	BUG: String concatenation can now be up to 253 characters, previously maxed out at 127.
	BUG: Can assign a floating value directly to an integer variable. a = 2.3 fails a = int(2.3) is okay
		 (actually not a bug technically, as it previously auto-truncated. Decided this shouldn't be allowed by default)
	CHG: Move stack into zero page okayed by Jessie O. Freed up 1/2k and also should provide slight speed boost.
	BUG: Sound module does not preserve setting of the I/O Control register at address 1 when updating PSG register.
	CHG: Colourising of constants in listing
	CHG: Colour set to a default value when typing in commands at keyboard.

Release 6 (26/11/22):

	CHG: Comments at the start of the line are highlighted in reverse.
	CHG: Can now list procedure by name e.g. list moveplayer()
	CHG: Changes to modules to allow for safe paging (see expandline.asm)

	BUG: Break check done every time, rather than 1 in 8 instructions.
	BUG: Pushing a byte on the BASIC stack would break if there was a borrow in the stack pointer. (bytes.asm) - not actually
		 detected in the wild but can't see how byte push could work as is.
