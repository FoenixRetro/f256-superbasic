\chapter{Writing Programs in SuperBASIC}

\section {Writing programs}
Programs in SuperBASIC are written in the 'classic' style, using line numbers. A line number on its own deletes a line.

LIST operates as in most other systems, except there is the option to list <procedure>() which lists the given procedure by name.

It is easy to cross develop in SuperBASIC, writing a program on your favourite text editor, and squirting it down the USB cable using a Python program , or the Foenix IDE.
